NvrHood - Location-Based Social App

University of Iowa, Hackathon 2018 Project - Prashul Shrestha, Amit Gyawali, Pawan Dhungana

About: NvrHood - an Android Mobile Application that uses Google Map Api to Track User's Location and share them with thier friends. 
Users can use toggle to enable thier location sharing or browse online users. 

Integration: Google Maps Api,
             Google Places SDK,
             Firebase (Backend)
             Google Login
             Firebase Chat
             Dark Map Mode
Reason: Living on the same university is awesome with lots of friends around, but everyone has different schedule and keeping track of everyone of our
        friend is very difficult. With that in mind, what if we could get the location and activity update of our friend on one platform therefore making
        us aware of thier presence which will help us create plans and be aware of our nect move. Such as knowing that our friend is hitting the Basketball
        court, the library, the gym, and so on. So you'll never be alone in the neighbourhood.
